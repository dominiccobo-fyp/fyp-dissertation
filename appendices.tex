\section{Appendix B - Notes on Project Infrastructure}
\label{projectAssets}

The project itself is hosted in its own self-contained Organisation on GitHub: \url{https://github.com/dominiccobo-fyp}. See Table \ref{table:artefactsInProject} for information on its components.

The build process is orchestrated through a Travis CI instance, which builds automatically on each committed push, creating the relevant artefact (Docker, NPM, VSIX and Java Jar) and publishing these within the GitHub Packages repository.
