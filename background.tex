\chapter{Background}

\section{How do we know the problem exists?}

Coming to terms with the ontology and epistemology of the problem do we realise, in a problem-driven approach, the importance of not limiting the streams of how we obtain information, nor constraining what is constituted as valid to that which is only of academic origin.

The intrinsic nature of the selection of tools is indicative of a personal preference on what we as humans consider individually useful. However, simultaneously the use of tools is theoretically supportive to the production and, or modification of a given software artefact to ultimately deliver business value - a measurable, quantifiable notion.

Similarly, the disconnection existing between academics - favouring empirical approaches - and industrial practitioners - valuing a mixture of sources based on experience - can serve as a source of how problems such as ours are investigated.

This suggests that what we constitute as the existence and exploration of reality and knowledge, in this case, is not a binary choice between ontological subjectivism and objectivism but rather a mixture of the two. Drawing from the strengths of both are we best enabled to contrast the different aspects of the problem. Understanding the objective nature of Realism, Empiricism and Positivism alongside the solely subjective nature of Interpretivism do we ultimately favour the stance of Pragmatism.

\section{How does fragmentation affect problem solving?}

%TODO;

\section{How has this proliferation been received by researchers?}

The large adoption, but not necessarily proliferation, of tools has not gone unnoticed in academia. The usage of tools generates an innumerable sum of data of immense use in supporting research.

Academic journals in Mining Software Repositories - e.g. \cite{Storey:2019:3341883} - have focused on exploiting this. Many of the papers in this field produce new tools, uncover new information or create new datasets, but generally fall short of make it readily available to routine decision making for the developers.

For industry practitioners and researchers, these tools have provided the base for measuring against particular benchmarks and, or within certain frameworks as a way of supporting improvement and advances.

% TODO: quantification needed

\section{How do we know aggregated sources [e.g. in an IDE] helps productivity?}

An Integrated Development Environment by definition aims to integrate a wide variety of tools used to develop software into a single cohesive scope. 

A by no means comprehensive exploration of literature from several sources suggests that IDEs and centralised information assist developers positively. 

Literature from the popular Software Engineering teaching resource Software Engineering \parencite{Sommerville:2010:SE:1841764} page 37, states that "IDEs provide a common platform to communicate"; in page 197, he further elaborates on this suggesting "IDEs are a set of software tools supporting software development".

Kersten's Project to Product \parencite*{kersten2018projecproduct} identifies the effect on the delivery of business value with the presence of a complex delivery chain of information, tools and processes.

Researching psychology studies on the effect of information fragmentation on a person's ability to complete a task provides ample insight. 

The research presented by Klemola and Riling \parencite*{klemola2002modeling} suggests that searching and using different tools forms part of the cognitive load that a developer must handle.

Sweller \parencite*{sweller1998cognitive} identifies that problem solving requires a significant amount of cognitive load. Miyake and Shah \parencite*{miyake1999models} explore the notion of limited working memory - which by extension establishes that there will be competition for cognitive resources. This shows that for developers, it is hypothetically detrimental to waste precious resources for problem solving on searching fragmented information.


\section{Are there any similar issues?}

The logic compatibility matrix issue is not an unexplored issue in the domain of IDEs and RTEs. In the not too distant past, each environment had a programming language which it primarily focused on addressing, other support was either lacking or implemented to a less full degree. 

This is known as the M x N language compatibility issue. For each environment, M, there exists the requirement to implement support for N given languages. Inherently, this results in the reinvention and, or reimplementation of the wheel for an identical requirement set bar the functional presentation and interaction.

Building upon existing understanding of the benefits obtained by decoupling presentation and logic, resorting to thin clients, does the Language Server Protocol \parencite{lspGitHubSiteMSFT} appear in recent years.

LSP provides a slim-lined model for solving the M x N language compatibility issue for development environments. The contextual model can be developed once for a given syntax and grammar and reused across all, providing these implement a very simple specification to handle interfacing with the user.

A consideration of the pull-based approach, we may consider extending the ideas developed by the Language Server Protocol to extend to the action and command APIs provided by most major IDEs (table \ref{table:1}).
