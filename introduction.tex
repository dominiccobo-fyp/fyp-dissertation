\section{The Problem}

\normalfont There are a wide number of papers illustrating the large amount of data that can be mined from developers' interactions with their toolchain. This tool-chain often includes task and bug tracking systems (e.g. Jira, GitHub issues), Version Control Systems (e.g. Git, Mercurial), Continuous Integration \& Delivery (CI/CD) platforms (e.g. Jenkins, Travis CI) and general declarative or/and imperative based infrastructure.

This activity of exploring this data is known as Mining Software Repositories.

Much of this information falls short of its useful potential as it is not made readily available to the developer and thus further falls short of proving any real ecological validity.
