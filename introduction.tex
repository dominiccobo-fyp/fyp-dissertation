\section{The Problem}

In the past two decades, perhaps as a result of the culmination of the DevOps and Agile cultural movements, business IT tools and the information these generate have proliferated exponentially.  %reference needed %

Toolchains are now extensive, encompassing task and defect tracking systems (e.g. Jira, GitHub issues), Version Control Systems (e.g. Git, Mercurial), Continuous Integration \& Delivery (CI/CD) platforms (e.g. Jenkins, Travis CI), documentation (e.g. Confluence, Wiki Pages), deployment, configuration, orchestration and a plethora more.

Each tool presents its own idiosyncrasies, each providing different approaches to performing a given task on a subset of information or data. Often their capabilities overlap with each other.

There are a wide number of papers illustrating the large amount of data that can be mined from developers' interactions with these toolchains. This activity is academically categorised as Mining Software Repositories.

This increase in information interaction entry-points, in pursuit of a more informed decision, can result in a significant competition for the mental resources applied task at hand, often yielding varying returns at the expense of the exhaustion of a finite mental resource.

Much of the usefulness that can be sourced both from the tools themselves, in addition to the derivative sourced academic counterparts, can fall short of providing any real ecological use to the developer given a lack of immediate availability to the context in hand.

Software Developers focus around the production of software artefacts through the construction of source code of a given grammar and syntax. This was once a pen and paper endeavour, transitioning towards text-editors and most recently to rich text editors (RTE) and Integrated Development Environments (IDE); this evolution granted a greater context into the piece of code being edited by a developer, theoretically enabling more informed decisions and easier manipulation of given said source.

Reframing this scope to encompass external context - in addition to the existing local focus - has produced extensions which integrate external information sources into the environment. Not withstanding this ability, the integration of these is as fragmented and diversified as the retrieval the sources which they interact with; pairing this with incomplete support matrix for IDEs and the inherent problems are apparent.

\section{The Vision}

To develop a common platform where context from any source can be EASILY integrated, aggregated and presented to the developer's working context when it is appropriate and, or needed to ultimately positively influence problem solving. 

\section{The Goals}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item[\#1] Develop a working IDE extension for at least one IDE that is capable of presenting the aggregated integrated information based on a relevant context for a particular topic or motif. 
	
	\item[\#1a] Facilitate the expansion of the historically local context scope of the IDE in favour of a more global, organisational, scope.
	
	\item[\#2] Establish a common integration point to ingest mined information from a given source. Imperatively, this must be modular and easily extensible to allow for a variety of data to be mined.
	
	\item[\#3] Establish an approach where logic implemented for retrieval, aggregated and processing can be re-used across multiple different IDE.
	
	\item[\#4] Reduce overall time taken to find relevant information for the present problem context.
	
	\item[\#5] Contrast the suitability of different information delivery mechanisms; concretely exploring, requesting - pulling - versus being fed - pushing - information, when it is somehow determined to be relevant.
