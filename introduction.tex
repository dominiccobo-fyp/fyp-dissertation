\chapter{Introduction}

\section{The Problem}

\normalfont There are a wide number of papers illustrating the large amount of data that can be mined from developers' interactions with their toolchain. This tool-chain often includes task and bug tracking systems (e.g. Jira, GitHub issues), Version Control Systems (e.g. Git, Mercurial), Continuous Integration \& Delivery (CI/CD) platforms (e.g. Jenkins, Travis CI) and general declarative or/and imperative based infrastructure.

This activity of exploring this data is known as Mining Software Repositories.

Much of this information falls short of its useful potential as it is not made readily available to the developer and thus further falls short of proving any real ecological validity.

\section{Aims and Objectives}

The aim of this paper is to provide a common platform through which mined content can be presented, aggregated by topics or motif, to the developer through an Integrated Development Environment's (IDE) context mechanisms which historically focused on local context scope rather than global organisational scope.

This forms a large assumption that developers want or/and will use the information presented to them; this poses questions as to whether it is best to take a push model (where information is presented based on IDE actions) or a pull model (resembling a more traditional query approach, where developers request information). Discussing and evaluating the appropriateness of each will be of substantial importance. 

This defines a minimum viable product of some form of interaction mechanism in an IDE whereby a developer can query a variety of mined data based on a given agreed topic. The initial topics to focus on are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Associated tickets.
	\item Code-base experts.
	\item Related documentation.
\end{itemize}

An example of the first deliverable  for this a pull query based on the Git upstream of the current file. This will focus on well-mined and organised data provided by the GitHub and GitLab public APIs before further exploration of less well defined sources and solutions.
